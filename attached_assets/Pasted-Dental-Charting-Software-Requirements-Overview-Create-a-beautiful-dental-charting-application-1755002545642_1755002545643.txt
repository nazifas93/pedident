Dental Charting Software Requirements

## Overview
Create a beautiful dental charting application called "Pedident Dental Charting System" that uses foot pedal input (numpad) for hands-free charting.

## Patient Setup Screen
- Fields: Name, IC Number, Location (default: "Faculty"), Dentist
- "Start Charting" button to proceed

## Odontogram Layout
Display rows of teeth diagrams for:
1.  20 deciduous teeth (baby teeth) with FDI notation
2.  32 permanent teeth with FDI notation

Each tooth shows 5 surfaces: mesial, distal, occlusal, lingual, buccal

## Charting Flow
**Starting sequence:**
- Begin with deciduous teeth (tooth 55, clockwise to 85)
- Press 1 to skip to permanent teeth (tooth 18, clockwise to 48)
- Press 1 again if want to finish charting
- able mouse navigation to specific tooth if necessary

**Visual feedback:**
- Active tooth blinks with blue drop shadow
- Auto-advance to next tooth after charting

## Basic Controls (Single Pedal)
- 3 = Sound tooth (white)
- 4 = Missing tooth (deep grey) 
- 5 = Carious tooth (yellow)
- - = Fixed prosthesis (blue)
- 6 = Go back one tooth
- 7 = Go forward one tooth

## Advanced Controls (Two Pedals - Optional)
**Surface selection:**
- 8 = Mesial surface
- 9 = Distal surface  
- 0 = Buccal surface
- . = Lingual surface
- + = Occlusal surface

**Detailed charting:**
- / = Enter detailed surface mode
- Select one or multiple surfaces (turn yellow)
- / = Confirm and proceed


## Export Function
Auto-generate PDF with odontogram screenshot
Filename format: [IC Number]_[Patient Name].pdf

## Technical Requirements
- React + Vite structure
- Modular, upgradeable codebase
- Keyboard/mouse for initial setup only
- Numpad-based foot pedal integration
- FDI notation system compliance

## Key Features
- Hands-free operation after setup
- Mix simple and detailed charting modes
- Visual tooth state indicators
- Automatic progression with manual override
- PDF export with patient identification. Make a modern app for this. intuitive
